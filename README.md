Single-cell atlas of SCLC leveraging scRNA-seq, MIBI, and Vectra imaging, as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network

Code for reproducing figures for Chan, et al. "Signatures of plasticity, metastasis, and immunosuppression in an atlas of human small cell lung cancer." Cancer Cell, 2021. https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(21)00497-9

Raw and processed data is available for download and exploration using cellxgene software at the HTAN data portal at https://data.humantumoratlas.org/.
Important note: Level 3 data holding UMI counts matrices at the HTAN data portal contain an additional feature column "CLUSTER" that represents Phenograph clustering output automatically generated by SEQC. It should not be considered a feature column of counts.
